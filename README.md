# Uptime Contrib Repository

This is a collection of OSS Kibana dashboards, and potentially other artifacts, to be used with the Elastic's Uptime and Heartbeat products.

## Dashboard installation

Kibana allows users to import pre-made dashboards to help you begin visualizing data quickly. You can install the dashboards hosted
in this repo using the *Management > Saved objects* page. Full documentation on this process is available in [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/managing-saved-objects.html).

After importing, visit the [Dashboard](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html) tab to view and edit your imported dashboards.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome: Dashboards, visualizations, config examples, etc.
